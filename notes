1. installed webpack , webpack-dev-server  : this is for bundling the code base.
2. installed babel (@babel/core | @babel/cli | @babel/preset-env | @babel/) : to transform ES6 syntax to common js which the browser can understand
3. installed react | react-dom : to use the react environment.
4. created an "index.js" file in the root folder.
5. created an "index.html" inside the src folder : where the react app will be rendered to the DOM.
6. created "webpack.config.js" file and added the webpack configuration code such as the entry, output, module, plugins and devServer.
7. created a .babelrc file where the babel plugin and preset is set.
8. installed html-webpack-plugin so i can use my "index.html" file as template.
9. created the react components
10. installed few react component libraries.
11. created the app layout components.
12. installed react-apollo | apollo-boost | graphql so i can connect my frontend app to my backend app.
13. got an error on arrow functions : the solution was to install (@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties)
